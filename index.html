	<a  class ="nav" > <h2>Drum Lessons for all Ages and Levels</h2></a>
    <img src="images/headshot2.gif" />
   <p>Would you like to learn how to play the Drums? I am an experienced drummer and music educator and would love to show you how. I teach privately and at Bayview Glen School in Toronto.  Throughout my career I have played, toured and recorded with many great musicians, including tUnE-yArDs, Bernice, indie-rock band Sister Suvi and in the Jazz world Peripheral Vision, Monk's Music, Rhododendron and many other award-winning artists. These days, as a freelancer in Toronto, I play in original jazz projects, musicals, classical chamber music concerts, country bands and singer-songwriter projects. In general I have a ton of experience to share with my students.</p>
   <p>I've been playing for a long time and have made - and learned from - a lot of mistakes along the way. While there are certain basic concepts that I feel everyone should learn, I adapt my lesson plans to suit each individual student's learning style. Everyone has to find their own relationship with music and I believe I can help you find yours - whether it's playing by yourself at home in your spare time, going on to play music professionally, or anything in between. I love to teach all levels and all ages.</p>
   <p>I have a BMus from McGill University and Masters Degree from CUNY Queens College in Jazz Performance. While my main instrument is drum set, I also play many other percussion instruments, piano, guitar and am a singer and a composer. </p>
   <p>We can meet at my studio on the Danforth or I can come to your house anywhere in the Toronto area.</p>
   <p>Thank you, and please send me an <a href="mailto:nicodann@gmail.com">e-mail</a> to get started!</p>

<p>Nico Dann</p>
